The following packages are required for building:

Debian/Ubuntu:
apt-get install autoconf build-essential python-cjson libxen3-dev
apt-get install python-anyjson python-pip python-crypto
pip install pyxenstore

CentOS/RedHat, etc:

(Will update this later.  Use the packages above as a guide)


The following is needed for make install or make bintar:

patchelf  -- You can find a package for it here:
             http://hydra.nixos.org/project/patchelf/jobstatus
             Click the number to the left of the correct package


To build:

1) sh autogen.sh
2) ./configure
   (default prefix is /usr which means that the agent will be installed
   into /usr/share/nova-agent/<version>.  A symlink will be created in
   /usr/sbin for nova-agent)
3) make
4) make check
5) make install (or make bintar)
