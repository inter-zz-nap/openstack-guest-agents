# Internap OpenStack Guest Agents

This is a fork of the openstack-guest-agents code on Launchpad at
```lp:openstack-guest-agents``` with some Internap-specific customizations.

Building the Windows Guest Agent
--------------------------------

In order to build the Windows OpenStack guest agent, you must have 
Ruby/Rake/Albacore installed, plus the XenServer tools to run the unit
tests.  To install Ruby/Rake/Albacore, plus the XenServer tools:

1. *Install Ruby* -
   Run the [RubyInstaller for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org)
   Suggestion: Check "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" during the
   install.

2. *Install Rake* -
   From the command line, run: ```gem install rake```

3. *Install Albacore* -
   From the command line, run: ```gem install albacore```

4. *Install XenServer Tools* -

If you would prefer not to install Ruby/Rake/Albacore to build the .NET
code, take a look at these instructions on how to run [Ruby/Rake/Albacore
without installing them](http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2010/03/23/running-ruby-and-rake-and-albacore-without-installing-them/)

To build, type ```cd windows\xenserver``` in a command-line window, 
then run: ```rake install```
(If you do not have XenServer Tools installed, the unit tests will not run
successfully and it will fail the build.  As a workaround, run 
```rake compile``` then ```rake package``` to avoid runnig the unit tests.)

The build output can be found in ```windows\xenserver\builds```,
two Zipfiles: AgentService.zip and UpdateService.zip.
